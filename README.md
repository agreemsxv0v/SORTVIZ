Bubble Sort:

Definition: Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
Key Features:
It is straightforward and easy to understand.
It has poor performance for large lists and is not efficient in practical scenarios.
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in worst and average cases.
Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting algorithm).


Selection Sort:

Definition: Selection Sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It divides the list into two parts: the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the order) element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the leftmost unsorted element.
Key Features:
Simple implementation, easy to understand.
Performs well for small lists or nearly sorted lists.
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in all cases (worst, average, and best).
Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting algorithm).


Insertion Sort:

Definition: Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It iterates through the list, removes one element at a time and inserts it into the correct position in the sorted part of the list.
Key Features:
Efficient for small data sets or nearly sorted data.
Adaptive: efficient for data sets that are already substantially sorted.
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in worst and average cases, O(n) in best case (when the array is already sorted).
Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting algorithm).


Ripple Sort:

Definition: Ripple Sort, also known as Cocktail Shaker Sort, is a variation of Bubble Sort. It improves on Bubble Sort by moving in both directions through the list, swapping elements if they are in the wrong order.
Key Features:
Improves on Bubble Sort by reducing the number of passes needed.
Similar in performance to Bubble Sort but may perform slightly better due to bidirectional movement.
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in worst and average cases.
Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting algorithm).


Comb Sort:

Definition: Comb Sort is an improvement over Bubble Sort that eliminates small values in the unsorted part of the list, thus speeding up the sorting process. It works by comparing elements separated by a gap, which shrinks after each pass until it becomes 1, similar to the way a bubble sort works.
Key Features:
More efficient than Bubble Sort in most cases.
Comb Sort can be implemented as an unstable sorting algorithm.
Time Complexity: O(n^2) in worst case, but generally performs better than Bubble Sort.
Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting algorithm).
